EkList

A Craigslist-style website for individuals to sell items to other individuals.

Developed as part of the "Development of Web Applications and Web Services" course at Ã…bo Akademi University.

Should be entirely functional, if a bit poorly documented.
Uses the Django email backend for all communication through the site, and requires configuration for this in the "YaaS/settings.py" file.

Provided as-is with no guarantee of anything working as expected.
